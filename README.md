## Introduction

Simple Asset Relocation is designed for UdonSharp.

## How it works
Asset Relocation involves two Arrays.

'objects' & 'placements'

The 'objects' Array, is a container that will hold all the GameObjects you want to move.
The 'placements' Array, is a container that will hold all the GameObject locations.

Example:
An 'objects' example, would be a Couch.
An 'placements' example, would be an Empty GameObject created in the Unity Scene.


```
$ ./That one time at band camp.
```
